\textbf{Commit Feature Interactions}

Broadly speaking Commits interact with Features, when one affects the other in any way imagineable.
Obviously there is more than one such type in a Software Project.
One type that we won't focus on, but is still worth mentioning, are control flow interactions, which occur when a commit decides wether parts of a feature get executed and vice versa.
We will instead lay our focus on two other types, which we will now discuss in detail.

\textbf{Structural Interactions} 

We define structural Commit-Feature Interactions as the occurence of syntactical overlap between commits and features.
The syntax of a commit is comprised of commit code, namely code that was last changed by said commit.
Feature syntax is defined in the same way as being comprised of feature code. 
Identifying feature code is more complex however, as it is any code whose execution depends on a feature being active or directly uses some feature variables. 
Now, we say that a commit and a feature interact structurally when commit code is part of feature code and vice versa. 

\textbf{Dataflow-based Interactions} 

We define dataflow-based Commit-Feature Interactions as data that was changed by a commit being accessed by a feature later in the program flow and vice versa.
For programmers it can be difficult to be aware of these dependencies as they might be hidden and span over several files.
We provide software that can automatically discover these, which can aid a programmer's ability to find errors and remove bugs.
For instance detecting the latest commits that might have caused a bug in a certain feature can be enhanced by looking at its recent datflow-based Commit-Feature Interactions.
In this thesis, we will research the direction of Commit -> Feature, e.g. a Commit affecting a Feature through dataflow.
This direction promises more use-cases, like the example shown above, and interesting Research Questions.
