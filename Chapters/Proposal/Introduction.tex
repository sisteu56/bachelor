\subsection*{Goal of this Thesis}

The primary focus of this thesis is to gain an overview of how commits interact with fea-
tures in software projects. Our goal is to lay basic groundwork regarding this
subject, while leaving more detailed questions to future research. As previously mentioned
we investigate two types, strutctural and dataflow-based commit-feature Interactions. While
using both types separately can already answer many research questions, we will also show
applications utilizing a combination of both.
We aim to reveal insights about the development process of features and usage of commits therein 
with the help of structural commit-feature interactions and high-level repository information.
We will also investigate to what extend there exist commit-feature interactions
throug dataflow that cannot be discovered with a purely syntactical analysis.
