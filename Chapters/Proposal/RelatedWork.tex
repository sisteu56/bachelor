Investigating Interactions between Commits and Interactions between has already shown interesting results and possibilites... \\
Research about Commit and Feature Interactions... \\

\citet{sattler2023seal} combined low-level program analysis and high-level repository mining techniques in the form of Commit Interactions.
They computed Commit Interactions using mapped repository information and a static taint analysis.
They can be utilized to answer practical as well as scientific questions, which neither analysis can answer on their one. \\

What use are Commit Interactions \\
How were they computed \\
what are results \\

\citet{lillack2014tracking} first implemented functionality to track Feature taints along program flow...
