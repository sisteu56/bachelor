In this work we want to research the main properties of structural and dataflow-based commit-feature interactions.
Using high-repository information and a combination of both types allows us to gain additional knowledge on their properties.
Following this, we aim to interpret the findings in a sensible way.
Structural interactions and the injection of author information within them can be utilized to provide insights into feature development and usage of commits therin.
Dataflow interactions can unveil interactions between features and commits that cannot be discovered through a purely structural analysis.
Seeing how common they really are could encourage programmers to be more aware of them.
Furthermore, they can improve our understanding on which impact new commits have on features. 

Research involving interactions inbetween features and commits has shown that investigating interactions between program entities is a topic worthy of study.
For example, Sattler et al used dataflow commit interactions to allow for a more detailed understanding of author interactions in software projects. 
Commit interactions also make it possible to identify seemingly insignificant changes that have a central impact on the program.
Kolesnikov et al provides further indication for the wide range of subjects interactions can be used for.
Particularly, they argued that control-flow interactions between features can help predict performance interactions between them. 

We extend VaRA to implement the detection of structural and dataflow-based commit-feature interactions.
As we want to investigate several projects, we create reports containing all found interactions for them.
These reports are created inside the VaRA-Tool-Suite and contain either all structural or dataflow-based interactions of a software project.
The VaRA-Tool-Suite also allows use to work with the collected data and enrich it with high-repository information, such as information on which author a commit belongs to.
