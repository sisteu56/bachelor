%************************************************

In this thesis, we achieved an initial overview of CFIs in software projects, specifically structural and dataflow-based CFIs, their interplay as well as other properties influencing them.
We were able to answer or at least gain some interesting insights into numerous research topics we set out to investigate. \\
% new subsection
In RQ1, we found that the number of commits used during development varies strongly between the features of a project.
Here, the size of a feature is an accurate predictor for the number of commits as the two metrics are strongly positively correlated.
Regarding the usage of commits during feature development, we support the notion that they usually change a single feature as the majority of them only have one feature-related concern \ref{sec:commit_concerns}. \\
% new subsection
Similarly to the number of implementing commits, the number of commits affecting a feature through outside dataflow also encompasses a wide range among the features of a project.
Admittedly, our analysis potentially underestimates the number of commits whose dataflow stems from the outside, although this could be fixed in future research.
We say that a commit affects a feature through inside dataflow, meaning that the dataflow occurs inside the regions of the feature, when it also structurally interacts with the feature.
As the commit could also be partially located outside the feature, we could be dealing with an outside dataflow origin instead.
One way to solve this issue could be to track whether the commit taint (see section \ref{sec:interaction_analysis}), belonging to data being used within a feature, originated inside the regions of said feature. \\
% new subsection
We found conflicting evidence regarding the linear correlation between the size of a feature and its number of outside commits interacting with it through outside dataflow.
All of our four examined projects produce unique results ranging from positive to no and even strong negative correlations.
Further research is necessary to determine whether there exists an accurate predictor for the number of commits affecting a feature through outside dataflow where considering properties of a feature besides its size might be required.
% which properties
Likewise, our results regarding the proposed decrease in the proportion of outside to inside commits in a feature with an increase in its size are not conclusive.
While most evidence points to existence of such a relation, more projects must be examined to gather statistically significant data. \\
% new subsection
The fraction of commits part of dataflow interactions are not unanimous among the projects and more common than we expected in our proposal.
They range from every ninth commit in \textsc{xz} to more than every second commit in \textsc{gzip}.
Furthermore, we found that their fraction in a project is strongly influenced by the percentage of commits that structurally interact with features.
Specifically, we proposed that said percentage acts as a lower bound for them since we could confirm the notion that structural CFIs heavily coincide with dataflow-based CFIs discussed in section \ref{sec:combination_cfis}.
Still, our dataflow analysis revealed previously hidden interactions for the majority of commits interacting with features in all projects.
Nonetheless, future research should factor in the discussed dependency between structural and dataflow interactions to properly assess the amount of new information a dataflow analysis can contribute. \\

% new subsection
Although this was not a topic we initially intended to examine, we determined that commits used to implement features have an increased likelihood to affect other features via outside dataflow.
This implies that the data of certain features is strongly connected, which could serve as motivation to investigate dataflow interactions between features.
Discovering which types of features often share data and thus depend on each other could potentially have implications on other, for example bug-related \cite{nie2011survey}, interactions between them.
In relation to this, future studies might want to determine commits, located outside of features, whose code serve as an intersection for the dataflow between certain features.
The respective commits can additionally be considered when trying to find the cause of bugs or other issues occuring in relation to feature interactions \cite{apel2014feature}.
To determine these commits, our analysis in VaRA needs to be extentend allowing us to examine dataflow from features to commits as well.
Commits that are affected by and affect certain features through outside dataflow might be commits that are central to the interplay of the involved features. \\
% new subsection
One major problem we faced when evaluating RQ3 was that \textsc{xz}, which played an important role in answering the two previous research questions, was essentially of no use here.
That is, because \textsc{xz} was mostly developed by a single author, which means that its features only interact with a single author as well.
We therefore consider our results for RQ3 to be preliminary and advocate for the examination of more projects.
Still, the remaining projects have given us first insights on how authors interact with features.
We have generally found that a feature has more authors affecting it through outside dataflow than structurally interacting authors, i.e. those directly involved in its implementation.
Out of the authors implementing a feature, only around half of them also introduce changes later influencing them via outside dataflow.
Considering this, it follows that a substantial number of authors interacting with a feature exclusively do so through dataflow.
Thus, our dataflow analysis was able to discover many additional interacting authors of features that we could not reveal with our structural analysis. \\
% new subsection
Across all RQs, we have seen that projects encompassing a higher number of features produce statistically more significant correlations than projects encompassing less features.
Particularly, \textsc{xz} and \textsc{gzip} encompass at least 10 features and generally produce p-values falling out of our pre-defined rejection interval, whereas this is not the case for \textsc{bzip2} and \textsc{lrzip} encompassing 8 and 3 features respectively.
% while strength of corr. coeff. plays a role, we still need a higher number of datapoints to produce significant data
We therefore propose that future research should preferably investigate projects with a minimum of 10 features if they intent to compute pearson correlation coefficients or other metrics relying on the number of provided datapoints. \\
% new subsection
\textsc{gzip} has shown initial evidence for the impact and consequences a high degree of feature-nesting can have on our generated data.
As sets of features share the majority of instructions constituting their size, it follows that they largely interact with the same commits structurally and through dataflow.
Perhaps more surprsingly, we even find that features not sharing much code are often affected by the same commits through outside dataflow. % identical commits
Naturally, this phenonemon also manifests itself in clusters of features interacting with the same authors.
We are aware that a high degree of feature-nesting in \textsc{gzip} casts some doubt on the implied meaning of the collected CFIs.
For the respective features, we cannot be sure what fraction of their interactions occur in instructions actually implementing their specific functionality.
While solving this issue goes beyond the scope of our work, it is important for us to adequatly adress and inform the reader about it.

- regarding dataflow interactions, we have only investigated dataflow in one direction, namely from commits to features \\

- we suppose that commits that are affected by and affect several features through outside dataflow are central to the interplay of the involved features \\
- as we have seen evidence that dataflow between features is quite common, there should exist many such commits \\

- more projects and of different domains => solidy or revise our results \\
- at least 10 features such that correlations are more likely to be statistically significant \\
- some RQs such as the correlation between the size of a feature and its proportion of outside to inside commits still left to be answered => more datapoints needed \\
