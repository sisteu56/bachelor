\chapter*{Abstract}

In software engineering, features play a pivotal role in implementing functionality of applications and adding configurability to them.
Their code is maintained in git repositories, where commits are used to introduce the latest source-code changes, thus gradually building the overall application and its features.
To allow for a deeper understanding of commits and features as well as their interplay, we connect both entities in the form of commit-feature interactions (CFIs). 
For this, we extend the interaction analysis tool VaRA to implement the detection of structural and dataflow-based CFIs.
As previous research has focused exclusively on interactions either among commits or among features, we are first to study interactions between the two entities.
