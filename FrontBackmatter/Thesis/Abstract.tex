\chapter*{Abstract}

In software engineering, features play a central role in implementing functionality of applications and making them configurable. 
Their code is maintained in Git repositories, where commits are used to introduce the latest source-code changes, thus gradually building the overall application and its features. 
To allow for a deeper understanding of commits and features as well as their interplay, we connect both entities in the form of commit-feature interactions (CFIs).
For this, we extend the interaction analysis tool VaRA to implement the detection of structural and dataflow-based CFIs.
While the former provides information about the direct involvement of commits in implementing features, the latter can uncover seemingly unrelated commits still influencing their functionality.

Similarly to prior research~\cite{michelon2021lifecycle}, we use structural CFIs to investigate the development process of features and usage of commits therin.
Instead of focusing on the set of features a commit changes, we study the responsiblities a commit deals with in relation to features giving us a more accurate reflection of a commit's purpose in feature development.
Specifically, we argue that a commit still deals with a single feature-related responsibility when it changes code of a nested feature or code implementing the interplay of several features.
We derive a best practice of commits in feature development, namely that commits should usually deal with only one responsibility, which we find to be enforced for the majority of commits (>70\%) in our examined projects. 

Furthermore, we choose a novel approach to fully assess the interplay between commits and features by being the first to study dataflow interactions between the two entities. % asses or understand
% one major goal was to determine the additional interacting commits that can be discovered for features through a dataflow analysis 


As previous studies have focused exclusively on interactions either between commits or between features, our work focuses on interactions between commits and features. % we delve into research topics that neither can answer on their own,

%Sehr unklar
% Was ist deine research topic
We address research topics that neither can answer on their own, including insights into the development process of features and usage of commits in it. % , in particular we show use cases for the investigation of CFIs,

We use our method to evaluate best practices in software/feature development, e.g., that commits should only change a single feature.

In order to study this, we did X

We found that this is a good idea because of results X Y Z

This enabled us, for instance, to confirm a derived best practice surrounding commits in feature development - namely, that commits should only change a single feature.
Furthermore, we find our employed dataflow analysis to be an essential part of gaining a complete overview of the interactions between commits and features in a project, as the majority of them take place only at dataflow level.
%It should be noted that a substantial amount of dataflow occurs within or between features, and does not stem from other parts of a program.
%That is, because commits constituting code of features have an almost certain chance of interacting with them via dataflow as well as a significantly increased probability of influencing other features. % this designates...

In this work, we also illustrate how CFIs can be applied to investigate an alternative albeit related form of interaction: author-feature interactions, achieved by mapping commits to their respective authors.

% RQ nicht definiert!
%As some examined projects proved to be unfit for investigation of author-feature interactions, we were not able to conclusively answer our research questions here.

% Conclusion
%Nevertheless, we are convinced that this form of interaction promises to improve the understanding of developers on their interplay with features.
% based on the applications we have worked out

%With this thesis, we accomplished an initial overview of commit-feature interactions, their use-cases as well as further applications and utilized them to determine dependencies between the involved entities. % the two involved entities
