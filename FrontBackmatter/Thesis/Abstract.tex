\chapter*{Abstract}

In software engineering, features play a pivotal role in implementing functionality of applications and adding configurability to them.
Their code is maintained in git repositories, where commits are used to introduce the latest source-code changes, thus gradually building the overall application and its features. % commits are an incremental unit of development
To allow for a deeper understanding of commits and features as well as their interplay, we connect both entities in the form of commit-feature interactions (CFIs).
For this, we extend the interaction analysis tool VaRA to implement the detection of structural and dataflow-based CFIs.
While the former provides information about the direct involvement of commits in developing features, the latter can uncover seemingly unrelated commits still influencing their functionality.

As previous studies have focused exclusively on interactions either among commits or among features, we are first to study interactions between the two entities. % we delve into research topics that neither can answer on their own,
We address research topics that neither can answer on their own, including insights into the development process of features and usage of commits therein. % , in particular we show use cases for the investigation of CFIs,
This enabled us, for instance, to confirm a derived best practice surrounding commits in feature development - namely, that commits should only change a single feature.
Furthermore, we find our employed dataflow analysis to be an essential part of gaining a complete overview of the interactions between commits and features in a project, as the majority of them take place only at dataflow level.
It should be noted that a substantial amount of dataflow occurs within or between features, and does not stem from other parts of a program.
That is, because commits constituting code of features have an almost certain chance of interacting with them via dataflow as well as a significantly increased probability of influencing other features. % this designates...

In this work, we also illustrate how CFIs can be applied to investigate an alternative albeit related form of interaction: author-feature interactions, achieved by mapping commits to their respective authors.
As some examined projects proved to be unfit for investigation on this topic, we were not able to conclusively answer our research questions here.
Nevertheless, we are convinced that this form of interaction promises to improve the understanding of developers on their interplay with features.
% based on the applications we have worked out

With this thesis, we accomplished an initial overview of commit-feature interactions, their use-cases as well as further applications and utilized them to determine dependencies between the involved entities. % the two involved entities
